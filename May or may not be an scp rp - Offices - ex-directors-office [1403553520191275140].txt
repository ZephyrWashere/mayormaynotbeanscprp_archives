Director, I'll be blunt. Marshall, Carter & Dark has certain... vested interests in a particular individual currently in your Class-D roster.

"Oh god..." He muttered before he kept talking. "Mhm, and what about the Class-D?"

Look, we're willing to pay [Insert boatload of money] if you'd be willing to at least have her on a trial period, if she stays to be a nuisance then let her out the foundation. Though it would be best to not let her get back into D-Class.

Walks into the office Hello sir, I am a member of MTF-TITAN-1, we are moving an SCP to this site and are now noticing you. The item will be arriving later.

Director [REDACTED]ᯓ★ˎˊ˗ He/Him BOT 8/10/2025 11:31 AM
He looked up from his computer, staring at Nightshade. "Do you have an estimated time? Or will I have to continue to anticipate?"

Nightshade BOT 8/10/2025 11:34 AM
No estimated time, we don't exactly work on written schedule. I recommend getting ready your quarantine, med lab, and to read up a bit on the Sarkics. The files for the SCP are arriving with it regrettably, so you'll have to read up on it when it arrives.

K (she/he) 8/10/2025 11:34 AM
We love Sarkic cult nonsense

Zephyr 8/10/2025 11:35 AM
yessir!!

K (she/he) 8/10/2025 11:36 AM
Technically sarkicism isn't even the correct name for them, it was made by mechanites

Director [REDACTED]ᯓ★ˎˊ˗ He/Him BOT 8/10/2025 11:37 AM
"I will, thank you for making me aware."

Nightshade BOT 8/10/2025 11:38 AM
Of course, and please, don't mention us on any reports. Say it was the Plague Tamers or something. We're still looking for them in this area

Director [REDACTED]ᯓ★ˎˊ˗ He/Him BOT 8/10/2025 11:38 AM
"Of course, your request will be respected."

Nightshade BOT 8/10/2025 11:39 AM
Thank you. Now, is there anywhere to rest? We've been running around for months.

Director [REDACTED]ᯓ★ˎˊ˗ He/Him BOT 8/10/2025 11:40 AM
"There are bunks and showers in this lower facility, only for you guys."

Nightshade BOT 8/10/2025 11:42 AM
Ah, thank you. Let's hope we don't have to talk too much more. He heads down to the showers

It'd be funny if this was hollander's site

Director [REDACTED]ᯓ★ˎˊ˗ He/Him BOT 8/10/2025 1:51 PM
He sighed. "Most of my employees are... intresting. But this is a very efficient site."

K (she/he) 8/10/2025 1:51 PM
But that'd mess with everything that has been established so far lmao

Nightshade BOT 8/10/2025 1:52 PM
I can tell. Now I have two questions for you. Where is a researcher that can deal with a biological scp, and what is this knife?

K (she/he) 8/10/2025 1:52 PM
He doesn't believe for a second that it's efficient

"I would say Dr. Baldinotti, but he is out of commision right now, we dont have many biologists on this site. And for that knife, I have no clue."

Alright then.. Well. I'll be heading outside for a moment. I need to communicate with my team. And again, no one knows who I am.

The Director listened to Kell, writing down notes on his computer.

Dr. Marianne Kell BOT 8/10/2025 3:00 PM
He didn't say much, seemed pretty secretive, but I think they're transfering some SCP to our site.
